This uses a combination of elimination and the backtracking alorithm to solve the puzzle.

## Instructions
The application can both randomly generate puzzles, as well as solve given boards.

Puzzles to be solved can be supplied in a plain text file, using the notation shown below. 
Puzzles can also be solved directly from any copied text in the system clipboard.

### Help
```
Sudoko Solver Alpha 0.0.9
Usage:
  SSolve.exe -g -c -s <filename.txt>

where:
  -g: Generate a fully valid puzzle
  -c: Create blank board layout to given file/screen
  -s: Solve using layout in either file or clipboard
      If no input file given, the clipboard data will be used
```

### Solve From File

1. Generate a blank template input file using the following command:
```
SSolve.exe -c[reate] <sudoku_template.txt>
```

The filename is optional. If none is provided, then a defaultwill be created.

2. Fill in the initial board state.
Fill in the blank cell spaces with the available numbers.
Please ensure that the layout is maintained.

**Here is a sample**
```
 +---+---+---+
 |79 |   |3  |
 |   |  6|9  |
 |8  | 3 | 76|
 +---+---+---+
 |   |  5|  2|
 |  5|418|7  |
 |4  |7  |   |
 +---+---+---+
 |61 | 9 |  8|
 |  2|3  |   |
 |  9|   | 54|
 +---+---+---+
 ```

3. Save your changes.

4. Let the application solve the puzzle by supplying it with the edited file.
Use the following command
```
SSolve.exe -s[olve] "sudoku_template.txt"
```

The application will now display the board whilst solving.

### Solve From Clipboard

1. As above, but copy your defined layout to the OS clipboard.
2. Let the application solve from the clipboard
Use the following command
```
SSolve.exe -s[olve]
```

## Remarks
The format of the input file can be more elaborate, as shown here:

```
+---+---+---+
|2 4|1..| ..|
| ..|5.3|6.7|
|...|9 .|4 .|
+---+---+---+
|9. |4..|.1.|
|65.|.1.|.74|
|.2.|..8| .9|
+---+---+---+
|. 9|. 5|...|
|5.2|3.1|.  |
|.. |..4|1 2|
+---+---+---+
```

Or it can be more compact, as follows:

```
.35.6.4..
.685....1
..4.1.9..
.9.....3.
.5....7.8
....3....
...1.6..9
.8.....76
.7.8..1..
```
The solver will ignore blank lines or separators (those that being with '-' or '+').
